Need to improve the way types are marshaled between JS and Swift. Main types are usually some form of type conversion.

An article about how optionals work in Swift: [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/136/the-complete-guide-to-optionals-in-swift]()

Side Note: Swift options are weird because the type information is not clearly shown and you have to use unwrap syntax to get the compiler to check it properly. 

Values are either numbers or string. They can also be a dictionary as well.

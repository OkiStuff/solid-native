/**
 * How it works:
 * For the most part, all data is represented in a normalized tree like so with a 
 * static class that can maniplate said chain.
 * 
 * The only thing SwiftUI needs is to be updated from the props values change.
 * SwiftUI does this with an observable object that is instantiated in some registry
 * separate from our element nodes. When the element nodes change, they update the
 * corresponding prop object in the registry that was used to build the.
 * 
 * To build it, all there needs to be a static method that takes in the node and subsquently
 * builds the SwiftUI struct needed. Only issue is that we may not be able to dynmically
 * build structs, only classes.
 */

/**
 * Swift UI needs a root SwiftUI view. We need to dynamically registure and load views.
 * SwiftUI Views are structs. They can be updated externally through observable objects.
